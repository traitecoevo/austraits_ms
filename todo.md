(2) The list of references and original sources needs to be reviewed.  Some are inadequately cited, don't have the full bibliographic data, lack websites or access dates.  Also references to unpublished data should include some indication of the affiliation of the author.  I assume that most of these authors would be listed as an author of this paper, but it might still be useful to include a reference to the institution here.  The list needs to help readers to find the sources, if need be.
